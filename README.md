HTML 5, CSS 3, JS, J2E, mySQL, MAVEN

Find here the source code of the web site I and ChloÃ© PELLETIER created. This is the first web Site with back end we ever build, so yes there is some monstruosity! One advice, don't look at the JS, never ever, it would make you feel bad. We didn't even use J-query and we generate like a lot of html by the JS. So yes the stability of the html can be questioned, and has to be! However the back end is not so bad, we used mostly ajax request and sometimes (for the session for example) we used servlets (mixing both was maybe not the best idea but it works and it s maintainable).

Hoewever we are pretty proud of the job we provided on it for a first project, so take a look if you are brave enought.
