HTML 5, CSS 3, JS, J2E, mySQL, MAVEN

Find here the source code of the web site I and Chloe√© PELLETIER created. This is the first web Site with back end we build, so yes there is a lot of monstruosity! One advice, don't lok at the JS, neve ever, it would make you sick. We didn't even use J-query and we generate like a lot of html by the JS. So yes the stability of the html can be questioning, and has to be!

Hoewever we are pretty proud of the job we provided on it for a first project, so take a look if you are brave enought.

/Site Client  : front end of the web site seen by the visitors.
/Site Intranet: front end of the intranet.
/cadrejee     : maven version of the website (front and back end).

BDDINITIALISATION : to initialize the database.
BDDCONTENU        : to fill up the database.
